But joy: like a good scratch to an itchy foot or the crunch of a perfect french fry.</p><p>We like to emphasize that we are not sustainable ascetics, we delight in shopping, we crave new additions for our wardrobe, we are grateful to receive gifts, but we also want to savor each purchase, appreciate each gift. So, here’s our bi-monthly list of things we got that we love:</p><p>I don’t know if its age, hormones, or winter, or perhaps a combination of all those things, but my scaly skin is a real downer this winter. I finally turned to my old friend: <a href=\"https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/the-blue-cocoon\">May Lindstrom’s Blue Cocoon</a>. Yes, it’s $180, but even my <a href=\"https://thrivemarket.com/p/cocokind-organic-chia-seed-face-oil\">organic chia seed facial oil</a>, which usually solves miracles, couldn’t solve the wan greyness. A little dab goes a long way, and makes your skin feel nourished and luxurious.<br /><em>– Sonjia Hyon</em></p><p>All my winter layering dreams can now come true with this <a href=\"https://www.thereformation.com/products/tara-top\">white, cropped turtleneck</a> from Reformation. Name one outfit that isn't instantly improved with the addition of white turtleneck, I'll wait... Still waiting….<br /><em>– Laura Jones</em></p><p>A happy client gave me this <a href=\"https://lalalandshop.com.au/collections/reusable-coffee-cups/products/eco-can-cockatoos-of-australia-eta-aug-2018\">La La Land reusable coffee cup</a> designed with pretty cockatoos. It’s BPA-free and biodegradable!! It makes me happy since it keeps my hot beverages hot and cold beverages cold.<br /><em>– Lauren Bush</em></p><p>As part of my goals to try to go plastic-free in our home, I purchased <a href=\"https://www.brushwithbamboo.com/shop/bamboo-toothbrush-adult-kid-family-4-pack/\">bamboo toothbrushes</a> for the entire family. There was weariness on whether or not bamboo toothbrushes would give as clean of a feeling, but it’s not crap, and it actually feels like it brushes my teeth! My husband doesn’t hate it and is happy with the conversion. Plus I’m one tiny step closer to a plastic free home.<br /><em>– Ciaraleaf Meaney</em></p><p>My boyfriend (!!!) gave me <a href=\"https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/sustainable-florists-new-york-city\">red tulips</a> the night he asked me to be his “official” girlfriend. I’m obsessed with flowers and nature, and tulips happen to be one of my favorites since they are feminine with a little bit of edge. I loved that they were romantic, but not traditional like red roses (nothing against them though!). Creativity even in the romantic details is always something special.<br />– <em>Eugenia Hernandez</em></p></div></div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\t</section>\n\t\n","date":"January 30, 2019","categories":[{"name":"Cash","slug":"cash-all-the-deals"},{"name":"Fashion","slug":"fashion-get-inspired"}],"tags":[{"name":"joyful resistance","slug":"joyful-resistance"}],"author":{"name":"Zakir Sajib","slug":"zakiruk"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"41b31975-c9bf-5c51-9b01-8a34178c061b"}}}
