Yes. Still we love WordPress.</p>\n","content":"\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">Draft: This is not complete.</pre>\n\n\n<h3>What is a WordPress 🙂 ?</h3>\n<p>WordPress is an open source CMS developed by Automattic and others contributors around the world. Its built with PHP and MySQL which are also open source and licensed under GPL.</p>\n<h3><strong>When is WordPress released?</strong></h3>\n<p>WordPress was released in 2003 with the latest version being WordPress 5.3.2 released on December 18, 2019.</p>\n<h3><strong>What do you need to run WordPress?</strong></h3>\n<p>We recommend servers running version 7.3 or greater of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://secure.php.net/\">PHP</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mysql.com/\">MySQL</a>&nbsp;version 5.6&nbsp;<em>OR</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mariadb.org/\">MariaDB</a> version 10.1 or greater. We also recommend either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://httpd.apache.org/\">Apache</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nginx.org/\">Nginx</a>&nbsp;as the most robust options for running WordPress, but neither is required.</p>\n<h3>Which is the PHP compatibility used for WordPress?</h3>\n<div class=\"toggle-content\">\n<section class=\"toggle\">\n<div class=\"toggle-content\">\n<p>PHP 5.2+</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"toggle\"></section>\n</div>\n<h3><strong>Posts and Pages – What is the Difference?</strong></h3>\n<p>Pages are static, they are not listed by date, and they don’t use tags or categories. They are permanent and timeless (unless you delete them).</p>\n<p>Posts are entries listed in reverse chronological order (the latest appears first). The exception is sticky posts that you can create if you want them to appear at the top.</p>\n<h3>What is a WordPress Theme?</h3>\n<p>In&nbsp;<b>WordPress</b>, a&nbsp;<b>theme</b>&nbsp;is a collection of templates and stylesheets used to define the appearance and display of a&nbsp;<b>WordPress</b>&nbsp;powered website.</p>\n<h3>What are the required theme files in WordPress?</h3>\n<p>In WordPress, 4 files are required for your theme to be accepted by the theme review team of WordPress.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>style.css</strong></li>\n<li><strong>index.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>comments.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>screenshot.png</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>But there are only 2 files absolutely required in a WordPress theme:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>style.css</strong></li>\n<li><strong>index.php</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What is the difference between a theme and a plugin?</h3>\n<p>The basic and fundamental differences between two are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a theme <strong>controls the presentation of content</strong>; whereas</li>\n<li>a plugin is used to <strong>control the behavior and features</strong> of a WordPress site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any theme we create should not add critical functionality. Doing so means that when a user changes their theme, they lose access to that functionality. For example, say we build a theme with a portfolio feature. Users who build their portfolio with our feature will lose it when they change themes.</p>\n<p>By moving critical features to plugins, we make it possible for the design of your website to change, while the functionality remains the same.</p>\n<h3>What is the basic structure or header parts of the main stylesheet and child stylesheet?</h3>\n<p>The main stylesheet and child stylesheet is <code>style.css</code> file. Main stylesheet belongs to parent theme. Stylesheet file (style.css) must be reside in the root directory of your theme not within the CSS directory. The basic and required parts are:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\">/*\nTheme Name: Twenty Seventeen\nAuthor: the WordPress team\nDescription: Twenty Seventeen brings your site to life with immersive featured images and subtle animations. With a focus on business sites, it features multiple sections on the front page as well as widgets, navigation and social menus, a logo, and more.

When WordPress loads your home page, the first thing it will look for is a&nbsp;<strong>front-page.php&nbsp;</strong>file. If that file isn’t available, the platform will fall back to&nbsp;<strong>home.php</strong>. Should both files be missing in action, WordPress will turn to the trusty&nbsp;<strong>index.php&nbsp;</strong>file, which is always there (otherwise, your theme wouldn’t work).</p>\n<p>In other words, here’s how this particular hierarchy breaks down:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>front-page.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>home.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>index.php</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Single Posts</h4>\n<p>Here’s how the hierarchy of single posts works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>single-{post-type}-{slug}.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>single-{post-type}.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>single.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>singular.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>index.php</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Single Pages</h4>\n<p>A single page follows this hierarchy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Custom template file</li>\n<li><strong>page</strong>–<strong>{slug}.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>page-{id}.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>page.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>singular.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>index.php</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Category and Tag Pages</h4>\n<p><a href=\"#catandtag\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">See the first example</span></a></p>\n<h4>Custom Post Types</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>archive-{post_type}.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>archive.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>index.php</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Search Results Pages</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>search.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>index.php</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>404 Error Pages</h4>\n<p>If you create your own error page, WordPress will look for it first, as demonstrated by this hierarchy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>404.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>index.php</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What is a Template Tag?</h3>\n<p>Template tags are used within themes to retrieve content from your database. The content could be anything from a blog title to a complete sidebar. Template tags are the preferred method to pull content into your theme because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they can print dynamic content;</li>\n<li>they can be used in multiple theme files; and</li>\n<li>they separate the theme into smaller, more understandable, sections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, the template tag <code>get_header()</code> tells WordPress to get the <code>header.php</code> file and include it in the current theme file. Similarly, <code>get_footer()</code> tells WordPress to get the <code>footer.php</code> file.</p>\n<p>Below are the list of some generally used template tags in WordPress</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get_header()</li>\n<li>wp_register()</li>\n<li>get_sidebar()</li>\n<li>wp_title()</li>\n<li>wp_enqueue_script()</li>\n<li>get_the_author()</li>\n<li>wp_list_authors()</li>\n<li>category_description()</li>\n<li>get_bookmarks()</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Custom post type</h3>\n<h3>How to write a custom widget?</h3>\n<h3>What is a Parent Theme?</h3>\n<h3>What is a Child Theme?</h3>\n<p>The extension of a parent theme is a child theme. In case you make changes to the parent theme, then any update will undo the changes. When working on a child theme, the customizations are preserved on an update.</p>\n<h3>Referencing or Including Other Files in child theme</h3>\n<p>When you need to include files that reside within your child theme’s directory structure, you will need to use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_stylesheet_directory/\">get_stylesheet_directory()</a>. Since the&nbsp;<code>style.css</code>&nbsp;is in the root of your child theme’s subdirectory,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_stylesheet_directory/\">get_stylesheet_directory()</a>&nbsp;points to your child theme’s directory (not the parent theme’s directory). To reference the parent theme directory, you would use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_template_directory/\">get_template_directory()</a>&nbsp;instead.</p>\n<p>Below is an example illustrating how to use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_stylesheet_directory/\">get_stylesheet_directory()</a>&nbsp;when referencing a file stored within the child theme directory:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">require_once( get_stylesheet_directory(). '/my_included_file.php');</pre>\n<p>Meanwhile, this example uses&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_stylesheet_directory_uri/\">get_stylesheet_directory_uri()</a></code>&nbsp;to display an image that is stored within the&nbsp;<code>/images</code>&nbsp;folder in the child theme directory.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\">get_stylesheet_directory_uri()/images/my_picture.png</pre>\n<p>Unlike&nbsp;<code>get_stylesheet_directory()</code>, which returns a file path,&nbsp;<code>get_stylesheet_directory_uri()</code>&nbsp;returns a URL, which is useful for front-end assets.</p>\n<h3>How to debug the theme? Or <strong>How will you display error messages during development in WordPress?</strong></h3>\n<p>To display error messages in WordPress. Open WordPress<strong>&nbsp;wp-cofig.php</strong>&nbsp;file and change&nbsp;<strong>WP_DEBUG</strong>&nbsp;constant value to&nbsp;<strong>true</strong></p>\n<p>In WordPress,&nbsp;<strong>WP_DEBUG</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>PHP constant</strong>&nbsp;(a permanent global variable) that can be used to trigger the “debug” mode throughout the website.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are WordPress Taxonomies?</strong></h3>\n<p>A taxonomy is a way to group things together.</p>\n<p>Default taxonomies in WordPress are <em>Category</em>, <em>Tag</em>, <em>Link Category</em>, <em>Post Formats</em>.</p>\n<p>However, you don’t have to limit yourself to default taxonomies; you are free to create custom ones as well.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Are Custom Fields in WordPress?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Custom fields</strong>&nbsp;are also known as&nbsp;<strong>post meta</strong>. Post meta is a feature in WordPress which allows post authors to add additional information at the time writing a post. WordPress stores this information as metadata in key-value pairs. Users can later display this metadata by using template tags in their WordPress themes if required.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of custom fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weather: Drizzle and Moderate Breeze</li>\n<li>Currently reading: To Kill a Mockingbird</li>\n<li>Favorite color: Green</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the types of hooks in WordPress?</h3>\n<p>There are two types of hooks 1) Action hooks 2) Filter hooks. To use either, you need to write a custom function known as a Callback, and then register it with WordPress hook for a specific Action or Filter.</p>\n<h3>Why we need hooks? What&#8217;s its purpose?</h3>\n<p>We use hooks to extend or modify the existing functionality of WordPress core. According to WordPress codex documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hooks are a way for one piece of code to interact/modify another piece of code. They make up the foundation for how plugins and themes interact with WordPress Core&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>What is an action hooks?</h3>\n<p>Action hook does not return a value. Action hook function is performing some kind of action just by being called.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">function frontlash_remove() {\nremove_meta_box( 'dashboard_primary', get_current_screen(), 'side' );\n}\nadd_action( 'wp_network_dashboard_setup', 'frontlash_remove', 20 );\n</pre>\n<h3>What is a filter hooks?</h3>\n<p>A filter is defined as a function that <strong>takes in some kind of input, modifies it, and then returns it</strong>.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">add_filter('the_title', 'strrev');\n</pre>\n<p>We use PHP function <code>strrev()</code>. It takes a string as an argument, and then returns the reverse of that string. We could use it as a filter function in WordPress, easily. Like, to reverse all your titles.<br>Another example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">function nirvana_filter_example( $title ) {\n\treturn 'Hooked: ' . $title;\n}\nadd_filter( 'the_title', 'nirvana_filter_example' );\n</pre>\n<h3>Difference between action and filter hook</h3>\n<p>Filters filter things. Actions do not. Filter Hooks behave very similar to Action Hooks but their intended use is to receive a value and potentially return a modified version of the value.</p>\n<p>Action hooks can modify data but doesn&#8217;t return a value. Filter hooks are used mainly to modify data so it depends on input and return that modified version of the input value.</p>\n<p>Also don&#8217;t mix it. When you mix the two up, then you stop us to interact with your code.<br>For example</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">function add_action($tag, $function_to_add, $priority = 10, $accepted_args = 1) {\n    return add_filter($tag, $function_to_add, $priority, $accepted_args);\n}\n</pre>\n<h3>Common action and filter hooks</h3>\n<p>Below are list of some&nbsp;<strong>Filter hooks</strong>&nbsp;functions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>has_filter()</li>\n<li>add_filter()</li>\n<li>apply_filters()</li>\n<li>apply_filters_ref_array()</li>\n<li>current_filter()</li>\n<li>remove_filter()</li>\n<li>remove_all_filters()</li>\n<li>doing_filter()</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below are list of some&nbsp;<strong>Action hooks</strong>&nbsp;functions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>has_action()</li>\n<li>add_action()</li>\n<li>do_action()</li>\n<li>do_action_ref_array()</li>\n<li>did_action()</li>\n<li>remove_action()</li>\n<li>remove_all_actions()</li>\n<li>doing_action()</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Give me an example of a custom callback function that you can use as hook?</h3>\n<p><code>change_admin_footer</code> is a custom function known as a callback.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">function change_admin_footer(){\n    // Your custom code\n}\nadd_filter('admin_footer_text', 'change_admin_footer');\n</pre>\n<p>We can also create our own HOOKS so that other developers can extend and modify our plugin or theme.<br>For example, a plugin has following function to add a settings form to administrative panels. We can use Actions to allow other plugins to add their own settings to it. This concepts are called <strong>Custom Hooks</strong>.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">function nirvana_settings_page_html()\n{\n   // some codes here\n    do_action('nirvana_after_settings_page_html');\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Now another plugin can register a callback function for the <code>nirvana_after_settings_page_html</code> hook and inject new settings:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">function my_add_settings() // callback\n{\n    // Your codes here\n}\nadd_action('nirvana_after_settings_page_html', 'my_add_settings'); // custom hook\n</pre>\n<h3>What is a custom hooks?</h3>\n<p>Custom hooks are created and called in the same way that WordPress Core hooks are. To create a custom hook, use <code>do_action()</code> for Actions and <code>apply_filters()</code> for Filters.<br>See the above example (how we modified the <code>nirvana_settings_page_html</code> function using custom hook using <code>add_action</code> with callback <code>my_add_settings</code>).</p>\n<h3>What is $wpdb?</h3>\n<p><code>$wpdb</code> is a global variable that contains of WordPress database object. It is used to perform custom database actions in the WordPress database. It provides the safest way to interact with database.</p>\n<p>For example, following code is unsafe in WordPress context:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">function perform_database_action(){\n    mysql_query(“INSERT into table_name (col1, col2, col3) VALUES ('$value1','$value2', '$value3');\n}</pre>\n<p>The code above doesn’t follow WordPress best practices which strongly discourages the use of any <code>mysql_query</code> call. WordPress provides easier and safer solutions through <code>$wpdb</code>.</p>\n<p>The above code can be modified to be as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">function perform_database_action(){\n    global $wpdb;\n    $data= array('col1'=&gt;$value1,'col2'=&gt;$value2,'col3'=&gt;$value3);\n    $format = array('%s','%s','%s');\n    $wpdb-&gt;insert('table_name', $data, $format);\n}</pre>\n<h3>What is Shortcodes?</h3>\n<p>Shortcodes are a type of filter. They take in content from the shortcode, they return replacement content of some sort. They are filters, by definition.</p>\n<p>Also keep in mind that shortcodes are supposed to return the replacement content, not just echo it out.</p>\n<h3><strong>How Can I Develop a WordPress Plugin?</strong></h3>\n<p>Here are the basic steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You need to come up with a unique name,</li>\n<li>create the plugin folder with a subfolder for PHP files,</li>\n<li>create the main plugin file,</li>\n<li>create functions for activation and deactivation,</li>\n<li>create an uninstall script and</li>\n<li>readme.txt file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>In WordPress, objects are passed by value or by reference?</h3>\n<p>In WordPress, all objects are passed by value.</p>\n<h3>How many pre-defined user roles in WordPress?</h3>\n<p>WordPress has six pre-defined roles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Super Admin</strong>,</li>\n<li><strong>Administrator</strong>,</li>\n<li><strong>Editor</strong>,</li>\n<li><strong>Author</strong>,</li>\n<li><strong>Contributor</strong> and</li>\n<li><strong>Subscriber</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each role is allowed to perform a set of tasks called <strong>Capabilities</strong>. There are many capabilities including “publish_posts“, “moderate_comments“, and “edit_users“. A default set of capabilities is pre-assigned to each role, but other capabilities can be assigned or removed using the <code>add_cap()</code> and <code>remove_cap()</code> functions. New roles can be introduced or removed using the <code>add_role()</code> and <code>remove_role()</code> functions.</p>\n<h3>Summary of Roles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Super Admin</strong> – somebody with access to the site network administration features and all other features.</li>\n<li><strong>Administrator</strong> (slug: ‘administrator’) – somebody who has access to all the administration features within a single site.</li>\n<li><strong>Editor</strong> (slug: ‘editor’) – somebody who can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users.</li>\n<li><strong>Author</strong> (slug: ‘author’) – somebody who can publish and manage their own posts.</li>\n<li><strong>Contributor</strong> (slug: ‘contributor’) – somebody who can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.</li>\n<li><strong>Subscriber</strong> (slug: ‘subscriber’) – somebody who can only manage their profile.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upon installing WordPress, an Administrator account is automatically created.</p>\n<h3>Basic understanding of WP Transient</h3>\n<h3>Basic understanding of WP REST API</h3>\n<h3>Basic understanding of WP Cron</h3>\n<h3>Basic understanding of WP object Cache</h3>\n<h3>Basic understanding of browser cachce vs page cache vs object cache</h3>\n<h3>How WordPress makes http requests</h3>","author":{"name":"Zakir Sajib","slug":"amgadvisor","avatar_urls":{"wordpress_48":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dba87ac5ae070265a4369be2b22a80ec?s=48&d=identicon&r=g"}},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"12 min read"}},"featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5035238841033673,"src":"/static/7f7af53a23d36f70d2ea7a6c7ee404e6/9e575/369bf-products-grid3.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7f7af53a23d36f70d2ea7a6c7ee404e6/2c3d8/369bf-products-grid3.jpg 125w,\n/static/7f7af53a23d36f70d2ea7a6c7ee404e6/91cbd/369bf-products-grid3.jpg 250w,\n/static/7f7af53a23d36f70d2ea7a6c7ee404e6/9e575/369bf-products-grid3.jpg 500w,\n/static/7f7af53a23d36f70d2ea7a6c7ee404e6/76e6e/369bf-products-grid3.jpg 750w,\n/static/7f7af53a23d36f70d2ea7a6c7ee404e6/79449/369bf-products-grid3.jpg 1000w,\n/static/7f7af53a23d36f70d2ea7a6c7ee404e6/0979f/369bf-products-grid3.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}},"date":"08/01/2020","slug":"wordpress-interview-questions-and-answers-in-2020"}},{"node":{"id":"0f8287ba-aa70-5ba0-b29e-9cdfc952fa98","title":"Questions and answers of node.js in&nbsp;2020","excerpt":"<p>Before Node, Javascript only runs in the browser and there was no way to run Javascript on server or any other medium. Node brings this options where the developer can run Javascript codes outside of the browser, on any machines, any OS.</p>\n","content":"<h2><strong>Beginner level</strong></h2>\n<h3>Differentiate between JavaScript and Node.js</h3>\n<p>Javascript is a programming language and Node is not a language, hence it is an interpreter and runtime environment for Javascript. Before Node, Javascript only runs in the browser and there was no way to run Javascript on server or any other medium. Node brings this options where the developer can run Javascript codes outside of the browser, on any machines, any OS. To run Javascript, you must install Node first and then you can run Javascript code. So basically Node allows creating an environment where you can play around with Javascript. Javascript uses different engines for different browsers. For example, Spider monkey is used in firefox, Javascript core in safari and V8 in Google chrome browser. Node only uses Google&#8217;s V8 engine.</p>\n<h3>What Is Node.js?</h3>\n<p>Nodejs is an open-source, cross-platform and JavaScript run-time environment. It is a lightweight framework used to develop server-side web applications and extends JavaScript API to offer usual server-side functionalities. Node.js is built upon Google Chrome’s V8 run-time—written in C++, built for multiple operating systems and super fast.<br />\nNode.js is single-threaded, that employs a concurrency model based on an <strong>event loop</strong>. It doesn’t block the execution instead registers a callback which allows the application to continue. It means Node.js can handle concurrent operations without creating multiple threads of execution.<br />\nNode.js is used for creating large scale application development, mostly used for video streaming websites, single page applications, and other web applications.<br />\nThe following are the areas where it’s perfect to use Node.js.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I/O bound Applications</li>\n<li>Data Streaming Applications</li>\n<li>Data Intensive Real-time Applications (DIRT)</li>\n<li>JSON APIs based Applications</li>\n<li>Single Page Applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the same time, it’s not suitable for heavy applications involving more CPU usage.</p>\n<h3>What Are The Key Features Of Node.Js? or Major benefits of Node.js</h3>\n<p><strong>Fast</strong> &#8211; Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript Runtime engine which makes the runtime engine much faster and hence processing of requests within Node.js also becomes faster.<br />\n<strong>Asynchronous</strong> &#8211; Asynchronous event driven IO helps concurrent request handling. All APIs of Node.js are asynchronous. It means if a Node receives a request for some Input/Output operation, it will execute that operation in the background and continue with the processing of other requests. Thus it will not wait for the response from the previous requests.<br />\n<strong>Scalable</strong> &#8211; Single Threaded but Highly Scalable. Node.js uses a single thread model for event looping. The response from these events may or may not reach the server immediately. However, this does not block other operations. Thus making Node.js highly scalable. Traditional servers create limited threads to handle requests while Node.js creates a single thread that provides service to much larger numbers of such requests.<br />\n<strong>Open Source</strong> &#8211; Node.js has an extensive open source community which has contributed to producing some excellent modules to add additional capabilities to Node.js applications. Another important aspect of Node.js from the developer’s point of view. The majority of developers are already well-versed in JavaScript. Hence, development in Node.js becomes easier for a developer who knows JavaScript.<br />\n<strong>No Buffering</strong> &#8211; Node.js applications simply output the data in chunks and never buffer any data.</p>\n<h3>Why Node.js is single threaded?</h3>\n<p>Node is entirely based on a single thread. It processes all requests on a single thread. But it’s just a part of the theory behind Node.js design. In fact, more than the single thread mechanism, it makes use of events and callbacks to handle a large no. of requests asynchronously.<br />\nMoreover, Node.js has an optimized design that utilizes both JavaScript and C++ to guarantee maximum performance. JavaScript executes at the server-side by Google Chrome v8 engine. And the C++ lib UV library takes care of the non-sequential I/O via background workers.<br />\nTo explain it practically, let’s assume there are 100s of requests lined up in Node.js queue. As per design, the main thread of Node.js event loop will receive all of them and forwards them to background workers for execution. Once the workers finish processing requests, the registered callbacks get notified on the event loop thread to pass the result back to the user.</p>\n<h3>How do Node.js works?</h3>\n<p>A Node.js application creates a single thread on its invocation. Whenever Node.js receives a request, it first completes its processing before moving on to the next request.</p>\n<p>Node.js works asynchronously by using the event loop and callback functions, to handle multiple requests coming in parallel. An Event Loop is a functionality which handles and processes all your external events and just converts them to a callback function. It invokes all the event handlers at a proper time. Thus, lots of work is done on the back-end, while processing a single request, so that the new incoming request doesn’t have to wait if the processing is not complete.</p>\n<p>While processing a request, Node.js attaches a callback function to it and moves it to the back-end. Now, whenever its response is ready, an event is called which triggers the associated callback function to send this response.</p>\n<pre>Let’s Take An Example Of A Grocery Delivery.\nUsually, the delivery boy goes to each and every house to deliver the packet. Node.js works in the same way and processes one request at a time. The problem arises when any one house is not open. The delivery boy can’t stop at one house and wait till it gets opened up. What he will do next, is to call the owner and ask him to call when the house is open. Meanwhile, he is going to other places for delivery. Node.js works in the same way. It doesn’t wait for the processing of the request to complete (house is open). Instead, it attaches a callback function (call from the owner of the house) to it. Whenever the processing of a request completes (the house is open), an event gets called, which triggers the associated callback function to send the response.</pre>\n<p>To summarize, Node.js does not process the requests in parallel. Instead, all the back-end processes like, I/O operations, heavy computation tasks, that take a lot of time to execute, run in parallel with other requests.</p>\n<h3>Where Node.js can be used?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><em>When Should We Use Node.Js?</em></span><br />\nNode.js is ideal for developing streaming or event-based real-time applications that require less CPU usage such as.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chat applications.</li>\n<li>Game servers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Node.js is good for fast and high-performance servers, that face the need to handle thousands of user requests simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>Good For A Collaborative Environment. </strong>It is suitable for environments where multiple people work together. For example, they post their documents, modify them by doing check-out and check-in of these documents.</p>\n<p>Node.js supports such situations by creating an event loop for every change made to the document. The “Event loop” feature of Node.js enables it to handle multiple events simultaneously without getting blocked.</p>\n<p><strong>Streaming Servers. </strong>Another ideal scenario to use Node.js is for multimedia streaming servers where clients fire request’s towards the server to download different multimedia contents from it.</p>\n<p>To summarize, it’s good to use Node.js, when you need high levels of concurrency but less amount of dedicated CPU time.</p>\n<p>Last but not the least, since Node.js uses JavaScript internally, so it fits best for building client-side applications that also use JavaScript.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><em>When To Not Use Node.Js?</em></span></p>\n<p>However, we can use Node.js for a variety of applications. But it is a single threaded framework, so we should not use it for cases where the application requires long processing time. If the server is doing some calculation, it won’t be able to process any other requests. Hence, Node.js is best when processing needs less dedicated CPU time.</p>\n<h3>What do you mean by the term I/O ?</h3>\n<h3>What is the difference between <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Asynchronous and Non-blocking</span>?</h3>\n<p>Further details: <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/</a></p>\n<table class=\"table is-bordered is-striped is-narrow is-hoverable is-fullwidth\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Asynchronous</th>\n<th>Non-blocking</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Asynchronous means not synchronous.

It includes details of the Node.js application or package. This file contains a no. of different directives or elements. These directives guide NPM, about how to handle a module or package.</p>\n<h3>What do you understand by <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Event-driven programming</span>?</h3>\n<p>Event-driven programming is a programming approach that heavily makes use of events for triggering various functions. An event can be anything like a mouse click, key press, etc. When an event occurs, a call back function is executed that is already registered with the element. This approach mainly follows the publish-subscribe pattern. Because of event-driven programming, Node.js is faster when compared to other technologies.</p>\n<h3>What is an <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Event loop</span> in Node.js and how does it work?</h3>\n<p>An event loop in Node.js handles all the asynchronous callbacks in an application. It is one of the most important aspects of Node.js and the reason behind Node.js have non-blocking I/O. Since Node.js is an event-driven language, you can easily attach a listener to an event and then when the event occurs the callback will be executed by the specific listener. Whenever functions like setTimeout, http.get, and fs.readFile are called, Node.js executed the event loop and then proceeds with the further code without waiting for the output. Once the entire operation is finished, Node.js receives the output and then executes the callback function. This is why all the callback functions are placed in a queue in a loop. Once the response is received, they are executed one by one.</p>\n<h3>Explain REPL in the context of Node.js.</h3>\n<p><strong>REPL</strong> in Node.js stands for <strong>R</strong>ead, <strong>E</strong>val, <strong>P</strong>rint, and <strong>L</strong>oop. It represents a computer environment such as a window console or Unix/Linux shell where any command can be entered and then the system can respond with an output. Node.js comes bundled with a REPL environment by default. REPL can perform the below-listed tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read</strong>: Reads the user’s input, parses it into JavaScript data-structure and then stores it in the memory.</li>\n<li><strong>Eval</strong>: Receives and evaluates the data structure.</li>\n<li><strong>Print</strong>: Prints the final result.</li>\n<li><strong>Loop</strong>: Loops the provided command until CTRL+C is pressed twice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><del>List down the tasks which should be done asynchronously using the event loop</del></h3>\n<h3><del>List down the steps using which “Control Flow” controls the function calls in Node.js</del></h3>\n<h3>What Is Callback In Node.Js?</h3>\n<p>We may call “callback” as an asynchronous equivalent for a function. Node.js makes heavy use of callbacks and triggers it at the completion of a given task. All the APIs of Node.js are written in such a way that they support callbacks.</p>\n<pre>For example, suppose we have a function to read a file, as soon as it starts reading the file, Node.js return the control immediately to the execution environment so that the next instruction can be executed. Once file read operation is complete, it will call the callback function and pass the contents of the file as its arguments. Hence, there is no blocking or wait, due to File I/O. This functionality makes Node.js as highly scalable, using it processes a high number of requests without waiting for any function to return the expected result.</pre>\n<p>Further details:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/control-flow/what-are-callbacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What are callbacks?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/martinnrdstrm/callback-functions-innodejs--2607\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Callback Functions in NodeJS</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Moderate and advanced level:</strong></h2>\n<h3>What do you understand by callback hell?</h3>\n<h3>How can you avoid callback hells?</h3>\n<h3>What Is EventEmitter In Node.Js?</h3>\n<h3>What&#8217;s your favourite HTTP framework and why?</h3>\n<h3>What&#8217;s a test pyramid?

In PHP a variable type is determined by the context in which it is used. If an integer value is assigned to a variable, it becomes an integer.</p>\n<p>According to PHP.net,</p>\n<blockquote><p>PHP does not require (or support) explicit type definition in variable declaration; a variable&#8217;s type is determined by the context in which the variable is used. That is to say, if a <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type string\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php\">string</a></span> value is assigned to variable <var class=\"varname\">$var</var>, <var class=\"varname\">$var</var> becomes a <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type string\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php\">string</a></span>. If an <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type integer\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php\">integer</a></span> value is then assigned to <var class=\"varname\">$var</var>, it becomes an <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type integer\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php\">integer</a></span>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For example,</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">$foo = \"1\";\n$foo *= 2;\necho $foo;\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"command-line\">2</pre>\n<p>Another example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">$foo = 10;   \n$bar = (boolean) $foo; \necho $bar;\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"command-line\">1</pre>\n<h3>Difference between <code>===</code> and <code>==</code> in PHP ?</h3>\n<p>The difference between the two is that &#8216;==&#8217; should be used to check if the values of the two operands are equal or not. On the other hand, &#8216;===&#8217; checks the values as well as the type of operands.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">if(\"22\" == 22) {\n    echo \"YES\";\n} else {\n    echo \"NO\";\n}\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"command-line\">Yes</pre>\n<p>The code above will print &#8220;YES&#8221;. The reason is that the values of the operands are equal.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">if(\"22\" === 22) {\n    echo \"YES\";\n} else {\n    echo \"NO\";\n}\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"command-line\">No</pre>\n<p>The result we get is &#8220;NO&#8221;. The reason is that although values of both operands are same but their types are different, &#8220;22&#8221; (with quotes) is a string while 22 (w/o quotes) is an integer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why would you use <code>===</code> instead of <code>==</code>?</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Difference between <code>$</code> and <code>$$</code> in PHP ?</h3>\n<p>The $ operator in PHP is used to declare a variable. In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign followed by the name of the variable. For example, below is a string variable:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">$var_name = \"Hello World!\";</pre>\n<p>The $var_name is a normal variable used to store a value. It can store any value like integer, float, char, string etc. On the other hand, the $$var_name is known as <strong>reference variable</strong> where $var_name is a normal variable. The $$var_name used to refer to the variable with the name as value of the variable $var_name. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">$Hello = \"Hello Nirvana\";\n$var = \"Hello\";\necho $var;\necho $$var;\n</pre>\n<p>Output:</p>\n<pre class=\"command-line\">Hello\nHello Nirvana\n</pre>\n<h3>Difference between <code>echo</code> vs <code>print</code></h3>\n<p>They are both used to output data to the screen. <code>echo</code> has no return value while <code>print</code> has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. <code>echo</code> can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while <code>print</code> can take one argument. <code>echo</code> is marginally faster than print .</p>\n<h3>Difference between <code>include</code> vs <code>require</code></h3>\n<p>Neither <code>include</code> or <code>require</code> are functions, they are constructs. It is therefore not necessary to call them using parentheses like</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">include('file.php');</pre>\n<p>instead it is preferred to use</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">include 'file.php'</pre>\n<p>The difference between <code>include</code> and <code>require</code> arises when the file being included cannot be found: <code>include</code> will emit a warning <code>(E_WARNING)</code> and the script will continue, whereas <code>require</code> will emit a fatal error <code>(E_COMPILE_ERROR)</code> and halt the script.<br />\nIf the file being included is critical to the rest of the script running correctly then you need to use <code>require</code>.<br />\n<code>include_once</code> and <code>require_once</code> behave like <code>include</code> and <code>require</code> respectively, except they will only include the file if it has not already been included. Otherwise, they throw the same sort of errors.</p>\n<p>So to summarize, they both include a specific file but on require the process exits with a fatal error if the file can’t be included, while include statement may still pass and jump to the next step in the execution.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main error types in PHP and how do they differ?</strong></h3>\n<p>In PHP there are three main type of errors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Notices</strong> – Simple, non-critical errors that are occurred during the script execution. An example of a Notice would be accessing an undefined variable.</li>\n<li><strong>Warnings</strong> – more important errors than Notices, however the scripts continue the execution. An example would be <code>include()</code> a file that does not exist.</li>\n<li><strong>Fatal</strong> – this type of error causes a termination of the script execution when it occurs. An example of a Fatal error would be accessing a property of a non-existent object or <code>require()</code> a non-existent file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>How can you enable error reporting in PHP?</strong></h3>\n<p>Check if “<code>display_errors</code>” is equal “on” in the <strong>php.ini</strong> or declare “<code>ini_set('display_errors', 1)</code>” in your script.<br />\nThen, include “<code>error_reporting(E_ALL)</code>” in your code to display all types of error messages during the script execution.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is the difference between <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>GET displays the submitted data as part of the URL, during POST this information is not shown as it’s encoded in the request.</li>\n<li>GET can handle a maximum of 2048 characters, POST has no such restrictions.</li>\n<li>GET allows only ASCII data, POST has no restrictions, binary data are also allowed.</li>\n<li>Normally GET is used to retrieve data while POST to insert and update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are Traits?</strong></h3>\n<p>Traits are a mechanism that allows you to create reusable code in languages like PHP where multiple inheritance is not supported. A Trait cannot be instantiated on its own.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the 3 scope levels available in PHP and how would you define them?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Private</strong> – Visible only in its own class<br />\n<strong>Public</strong> – Visible to any other code accessing the class<br />\n<strong>Protected</strong> – Visible only to classes parent(s) and classes that extend the current class</p>\n<h3 id=\"overriding-overloading\"><strong>What is overloading and overriding in PHP?</strong></h3>\n<p>Function overloading and overriding is the OOPs feature in PHP. In function overloading, more than one function can have same method signature but different number of arguments. But in case of function overriding, more than one functions will have same method signature and number of arguments.<br />\n<strong>Overriding</strong> &#8211; <strong>Overriding</strong> is only pertinent to derived classes, where the parent class has defined a method and the derived class wishes to <strong>override</strong> that method. An example of <strong>overriding</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">class Foo { \n  function myFoo() { \n    return \"Foo\"; \n  } \n} \nclass Bar extends Foo { \n  function myFoo() { \n    return \"Bar\"; \n  } \n} \n$foo = new Foo; \n$bar = new Bar; \necho($foo-&gt;myFoo()); //\"Foo\"\necho($bar-&gt;myFoo()); //\"Bar\"\n</pre>\n<p>Another example: Inherited methods can be overridden by redefining the methods (use the same name) in the child class.<br />\nLook at the example below. The __construct() and intro() methods in the child class (Strawberry) will override the __construct() and intro() methods in the parent class (Fruit):</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\"> \nclass Fruit { \n  public $name; public $color; \n  public function __construct($name, $color) { \n    $this-&gt;name = $name;\n    $this-&gt;color = $color; \n  }\n  public function intro() {\n    echo \"The fruit is {$this-&gt;name} and the color is {$this-&gt;color}.\"; \n  }\n}\n\nclass Strawberry extends Fruit {\n  public $weight;\n  public function __construct($name, $color, $weight) {\n    $this-&gt;name = $name;\n    $this-&gt;color = $color;\n    $this-&gt;weight = $weight; \n  }\n  public function intro() {\n    echo \"The fruit is {$this-&gt;name}, the color is {$this-&gt;color}, and the weight is {$this-&gt;weight} gram.\"; \n  }\n}\n\n$strawberry = new Strawberry(\"Strawberry\", \"red\", 50);\n$strawberry-&gt;intro();\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Overloading</strong> &#8211; Function overloading contains same function name and that function preforms different task according to number of arguments. In PHP function overloading is done with the help of magic function <code>__call()</code>.</p>\n<p>An example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">class shape { \n// __call is magic function which accepts \n// function name and arguments \nfunction __call($name_of_function, $arguments) { \t\t\n  // It will match the function name \n  if($name_of_function == 'area') { \t\n    switch (count($arguments)) { \t\t\n\t// If there is only one argument \n\t// area of circle \n\tcase 1: \n\t  return 3.14 * $arguments[0]; \t\t\t\n\t// IF two arguments then area is rectangel; \n\tcase 2: \n\t  return $arguments[0]*$arguments[1]; \n\t} \n     } \n   } \n} \n\t\n$s = new Shape; \n\t\necho($s-&gt;area(2)); \necho \"n\"; \n\necho ($s-&gt;area(4, 2)); \n</pre>\n<h3 id=\"final\">How to prevent class inheritance or to prevent method overriding?</h3>\n<p>The <code>final</code> keyword can be used to prevent class inheritance or to prevent method overriding.<br />\nThe following example shows how to prevent class inheritance:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">final class Fruit {\n  // some code\n}\n\n// will result in error\nclass Strawberry extends Fruit {\n  // some code\n}\n</pre>\n<p>The following example shows how to prevent method overriding:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">class Fruit {\n  final public function intro() {\n    // some code\n  }\n}\n\nclass Strawberry extends Fruit {\n  // will result in error\n  public function intro() {\n    // some code\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n<h3><strong>How does one prevent the following Warning ‘Warning: Cannot modify header information – headers already sent’ and why does it occur in the first place?</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>What are SQL Injections, how do you prevent them and what are the best practices?</strong></h3>\n","author":{"name":"Zakir Sajib","slug":"amgadvisor","avatar_urls":{"wordpress_48":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dba87ac5ae070265a4369be2b22a80ec?s=48&d=identicon&r=g"}},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"9 min read"}},"featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5857284440039643,"src":"/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/9e575/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/2c3d8/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg 125w,\n/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/91cbd/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg 250w,\n/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/9e575/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg 500w,\n/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/76e6e/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg 750w,\n/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/79449/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg 1000w,\n/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/a5547/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}},"date":"19/05/2019","slug":"php-interview-questions-answers"}}]}},"pageContext":{"name":"interview","slug":"interview"}}}
