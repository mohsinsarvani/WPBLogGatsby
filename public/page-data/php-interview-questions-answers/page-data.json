In PHP a variable type is determined by the context in which it is used. If an integer value is assigned to a variable, it becomes an integer.</p>\n<p>According to PHP.net,</p>\n<blockquote><p>PHP does not require (or support) explicit type definition in variable declaration; a variable&#8217;s type is determined by the context in which the variable is used. That is to say, if a <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type string\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php\">string</a></span> value is assigned to variable <var class=\"varname\">$var</var>, <var class=\"varname\">$var</var> becomes a <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type string\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php\">string</a></span>. If an <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type integer\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php\">integer</a></span> value is then assigned to <var class=\"varname\">$var</var>, it becomes an <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type integer\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php\">integer</a></span>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For example,</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">$foo = \"1\";\n$foo *= 2;\necho $foo;\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"command-line\">2</pre>\n<p>Another example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">$foo = 10;   \n$bar = (boolean) $foo; \necho $bar;\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"command-line\">1</pre>\n<h3>Difference between <code>===</code> and <code>==</code> in PHP ?</h3>\n<p>The difference between the two is that &#8216;==&#8217; should be used to check if the values of the two operands are equal or not. On the other hand, &#8216;===&#8217; checks the values as well as the type of operands.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">if(\"22\" == 22) {\n    echo \"YES\";\n} else {\n    echo \"NO\";\n}\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"command-line\">Yes</pre>\n<p>The code above will print &#8220;YES&#8221;. The reason is that the values of the operands are equal.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">if(\"22\" === 22) {\n    echo \"YES\";\n} else {\n    echo \"NO\";\n}\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"command-line\">No</pre>\n<p>The result we get is &#8220;NO&#8221;. The reason is that although values of both operands are same but their types are different, &#8220;22&#8221; (with quotes) is a string while 22 (w/o quotes) is an integer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why would you use <code>===</code> instead of <code>==</code>?</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Difference between <code>$</code> and <code>$$</code> in PHP ?</h3>\n<p>The $ operator in PHP is used to declare a variable. In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign followed by the name of the variable. For example, below is a string variable:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">$var_name = \"Hello World!\";</pre>\n<p>The $var_name is a normal variable used to store a value. It can store any value like integer, float, char, string etc. On the other hand, the $$var_name is known as <strong>reference variable</strong> where $var_name is a normal variable. The $$var_name used to refer to the variable with the name as value of the variable $var_name. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">$Hello = \"Hello Nirvana\";\n$var = \"Hello\";\necho $var;\necho $$var;\n</pre>\n<p>Output:</p>\n<pre class=\"command-line\">Hello\nHello Nirvana\n</pre>\n<h3>Difference between <code>echo</code> vs <code>print</code></h3>\n<p>They are both used to output data to the screen. <code>echo</code> has no return value while <code>print</code> has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. <code>echo</code> can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while <code>print</code> can take one argument. <code>echo</code> is marginally faster than print .</p>\n<h3>Difference between <code>include</code> vs <code>require</code></h3>\n<p>Neither <code>include</code> or <code>require</code> are functions, they are constructs. It is therefore not necessary to call them using parentheses like</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">include('file.php');</pre>\n<p>instead it is preferred to use</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">include 'file.php'</pre>\n<p>The difference between <code>include</code> and <code>require</code> arises when the file being included cannot be found: <code>include</code> will emit a warning <code>(E_WARNING)</code> and the script will continue, whereas <code>require</code> will emit a fatal error <code>(E_COMPILE_ERROR)</code> and halt the script.<br />\nIf the file being included is critical to the rest of the script running correctly then you need to use <code>require</code>.<br />\n<code>include_once</code> and <code>require_once</code> behave like <code>include</code> and <code>require</code> respectively, except they will only include the file if it has not already been included. Otherwise, they throw the same sort of errors.</p>\n<p>So to summarize, they both include a specific file but on require the process exits with a fatal error if the file can’t be included, while include statement may still pass and jump to the next step in the execution.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main error types in PHP and how do they differ?</strong></h3>\n<p>In PHP there are three main type of errors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Notices</strong> – Simple, non-critical errors that are occurred during the script execution. An example of a Notice would be accessing an undefined variable.</li>\n<li><strong>Warnings</strong> – more important errors than Notices, however the scripts continue the execution. An example would be <code>include()</code> a file that does not exist.</li>\n<li><strong>Fatal</strong> – this type of error causes a termination of the script execution when it occurs. An example of a Fatal error would be accessing a property of a non-existent object or <code>require()</code> a non-existent file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>How can you enable error reporting in PHP?</strong></h3>\n<p>Check if “<code>display_errors</code>” is equal “on” in the <strong>php.ini</strong> or declare “<code>ini_set('display_errors', 1)</code>” in your script.<br />\nThen, include “<code>error_reporting(E_ALL)</code>” in your code to display all types of error messages during the script execution.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is the difference between <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>GET displays the submitted data as part of the URL, during POST this information is not shown as it’s encoded in the request.</li>\n<li>GET can handle a maximum of 2048 characters, POST has no such restrictions.</li>\n<li>GET allows only ASCII data, POST has no restrictions, binary data are also allowed.</li>\n<li>Normally GET is used to retrieve data while POST to insert and update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are Traits?</strong></h3>\n<p>Traits are a mechanism that allows you to create reusable code in languages like PHP where multiple inheritance is not supported. A Trait cannot be instantiated on its own.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the 3 scope levels available in PHP and how would you define them?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Private</strong> – Visible only in its own class<br />\n<strong>Public</strong> – Visible to any other code accessing the class<br />\n<strong>Protected</strong> – Visible only to classes parent(s) and classes that extend the current class</p>\n<h3 id=\"overriding-overloading\"><strong>What is overloading and overriding in PHP?</strong></h3>\n<p>Function overloading and overriding is the OOPs feature in PHP. In function overloading, more than one function can have same method signature but different number of arguments. But in case of function overriding, more than one functions will have same method signature and number of arguments.<br />\n<strong>Overriding</strong> &#8211; <strong>Overriding</strong> is only pertinent to derived classes, where the parent class has defined a method and the derived class wishes to <strong>override</strong> that method. An example of <strong>overriding</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">class Foo { \n  function myFoo() { \n    return \"Foo\"; \n  } \n} \nclass Bar extends Foo { \n  function myFoo() { \n    return \"Bar\"; \n  } \n} \n$foo = new Foo; \n$bar = new Bar; \necho($foo-&gt;myFoo()); //\"Foo\"\necho($bar-&gt;myFoo()); //\"Bar\"\n</pre>\n<p>Another example: Inherited methods can be overridden by redefining the methods (use the same name) in the child class.<br />\nLook at the example below. The __construct() and intro() methods in the child class (Strawberry) will override the __construct() and intro() methods in the parent class (Fruit):</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\"> \nclass Fruit { \n  public $name; public $color; \n  public function __construct($name, $color) { \n    $this-&gt;name = $name;\n    $this-&gt;color = $color; \n  }\n  public function intro() {\n    echo \"The fruit is {$this-&gt;name} and the color is {$this-&gt;color}.\"; \n  }\n}\n\nclass Strawberry extends Fruit {\n  public $weight;\n  public function __construct($name, $color, $weight) {\n    $this-&gt;name = $name;\n    $this-&gt;color = $color;\n    $this-&gt;weight = $weight; \n  }\n  public function intro() {\n    echo \"The fruit is {$this-&gt;name}, the color is {$this-&gt;color}, and the weight is {$this-&gt;weight} gram.\"; \n  }\n}\n\n$strawberry = new Strawberry(\"Strawberry\", \"red\", 50);\n$strawberry-&gt;intro();\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Overloading</strong> &#8211; Function overloading contains same function name and that function preforms different task according to number of arguments. In PHP function overloading is done with the help of magic function <code>__call()</code>.</p>\n<p>An example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">class shape { \n// __call is magic function which accepts \n// function name and arguments \nfunction __call($name_of_function, $arguments) { \t\t\n  // It will match the function name \n  if($name_of_function == 'area') { \t\n    switch (count($arguments)) { \t\t\n\t// If there is only one argument \n\t// area of circle \n\tcase 1: \n\t  return 3.14 * $arguments[0]; \t\t\t\n\t// IF two arguments then area is rectangel; \n\tcase 2: \n\t  return $arguments[0]*$arguments[1]; \n\t} \n     } \n   } \n} \n\t\n$s = new Shape; \n\t\necho($s-&gt;area(2)); \necho \"n\"; \n\necho ($s-&gt;area(4, 2)); \n</pre>\n<h3 id=\"final\">How to prevent class inheritance or to prevent method overriding?</h3>\n<p>The <code>final</code> keyword can be used to prevent class inheritance or to prevent method overriding.<br />\nThe following example shows how to prevent class inheritance:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">final class Fruit {\n  // some code\n}\n\n// will result in error\nclass Strawberry extends Fruit {\n  // some code\n}\n</pre>\n<p>The following example shows how to prevent method overriding:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">class Fruit {\n  final public function intro() {\n    // some code\n  }\n}\n\nclass Strawberry extends Fruit {\n  // will result in error\n  public function intro() {\n    // some code\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n<h3><strong>How does one prevent the following Warning ‘Warning: Cannot modify header information – headers already sent’ and why does it occur in the first place?</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>What are SQL Injections, how do you prevent them and what are the best practices?</strong></h3>\n","excerpt":"<p>These are a few PHP related questions for an interview.</p>\n","link":"https://zsbloggatsby.wordpress.com/2019/05/19/php-interview-questions-answers/","categories":[{"name":"PHP","slug":"php"}],"tags":[{"name":"beginner","slug":"beginner"},{"name":"interview","slug":"interview"},{"name":"moderate","slug":"moderate"}],"author":{"name":"Zakir Sajib"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"9 min read"}},"featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5824175824175823,"src":"/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/d9e57/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/872c4/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg 288w,\n/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/2f71c/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg 576w,\n/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/d9e57/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg 1152w,\n/static/9f4806488993300e167bb54738a5cf0e/06655/0ac18-oia-416136_19201.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"php-interview-questions-answers","previous":{"id":"de139484-2188-56fd-8809-e6385adc845b","slug":"install-composer-on-mac-os-x-el-capitan","title":"Install Composer on mac OS X El&nbsp;Capitan","status":"publish"},"next":{"id":"6f367941-1940-56d6-a19c-d538db3c1484","slug":"differences-between-session-and-cookies-in-php","title":"Differences between Session and Cookies in&nbsp;PHP","status":"publish"}}}}
