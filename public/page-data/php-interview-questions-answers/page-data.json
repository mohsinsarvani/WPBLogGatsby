In PHP a variables type is determined by the context in which it is used. If an integer value is assigned to a variable, it becomes an integer.</p>\n<p>According to PHP.net,</p>\n<blockquote><p>PHP does not require (or support) explicit type definition in variable declaration; a variable&#8217;s type is determined by the context in which the variable is used. That is to say, if a <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type string\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php\">string</a></span> value is assigned to variable <var class=\"varname\">$var</var>, <var class=\"varname\">$var</var> becomes a <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type string\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php\">string</a></span>. If an <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type integer\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php\">integer</a></span> value is then assigned to <var class=\"varname\">$var</var>, it becomes an <span class=\"type\"><a class=\"type integer\" href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php\">integer</a></span>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For example,</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">$foo = \"1\";\r\n$foo *= 2;\r\necho $foo;\r\n\r\nOutput: 2</pre>\n<h3>Difference between <code>===</code> and <code>==</code> in PHP ?</h3>\n<p>The difference between the two is that &#8216;==&#8217; should be used to check if the values of the two operands are equal or not. On the other hand, &#8216;===&#8217; checks the values as well as the type of operands.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">if(\"22\" == 22) {\r\n    echo \"YES\";\r\n} else {\r\n    echo \"NO\";\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>: Yes<br />\nThe code above will print &#8220;YES&#8221;. The reason is that the values of the operands are equal.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">if(\"22\" === 22) {\r\n    echo \"YES\";\r\n} else {\r\n    echo \"NO\";\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>: No<br />\nThe result we get is &#8220;NO&#8221;. The reason is that although values of both operands are same but their types are different, &#8220;22&#8221; (with quotes) is a string while 22 (w/o quotes) is an integer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why would you use <code>===</code> instead of <code>==</code>?</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Difference between <code>$</code> and <code>$$</code> in PHP ?</h3>\n<p>The $ operator in PHP is used to declare a variable. In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign followed by the name of the variable. For example, below is a string variable:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">$var_name = \"Hello World!\";</pre>\n<p>The $var_name is a normal variable used to store a value. It can store any value like integer, float, char, string etc. On the other hand, the $$var_name is known as reference variable where $var_name is a normal variable. The $$var_name used to refer to the variable with the name as value of the variable $var_name. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">$Hello = \"Geeks for Geeks\";\r\n$var = \"Hello\";\r\necho $var;\r\necho $$var;\r\n</pre>\n<h3>Difference between <code>echo</code> vs <code>print</code></h3>\n<p>They are both used to output data to the screen. <code>echo</code> has no return value while <code>print</code> has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. <code>echo</code> can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while <code>print</code> can take one argument. <code>echo</code> is marginally faster than print .</p>\n<h3>Difference between <code>include</code> vs <code>require</code></h3>\n<p>Neither <code>include</code> or <code>require</code> are functions, they are constructs. It is therefore not necessary to call them using parentheses like</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">include('file.php');</pre>\n<p>instead it is preferred to use</p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\">include 'file.php'</pre>\n<p>The difference between <code>include</code> and <code>require</code> arises when the file being included cannot be found: <code>include</code> will emit a warning <code>(E_WARNING)</code> and the script will continue, whereas <code>require</code> will emit a fatal error <code>(E_COMPILE_ERROR)</code> and halt the script.<br />\nIf the file being included is critical to the rest of the script running correctly then you need to use <code>require</code>.<br />\n<code>include_once</code> and <code>require_once</code> behave like <code>include</code> and <code>require</code> respectively, except they will only include the file if it has not already been included. Otherwise, they throw the same sort of errors.</p>\n<p>So to summarize, they both include a specific file but on require the process exits with a fatal error if the file can’t be included, while include statement may still pass and jump to the next step in the execution.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the main error types in PHP and how do they differ?</strong></h3>\n<p>In PHP there are three main type of errors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Notices</strong> – Simple, non-critical errors that are occurred during the script execution. An example of a Notice would be accessing an undefined variable.</li>\n<li><strong>Warnings</strong> – more important errors than Notices, however the scripts continue the execution. An example would be <code>include()</code> a file that does not exist.</li>\n<li><strong>Fatal</strong> – this type of error causes a termination of the script execution when it occurs. An example of a Fatal error would be accessing a property of a non-existent object or <code>require()</code> a non-existent file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>How can you enable error reporting in PHP?</strong></h3>\n<p>Check if “<code>display_errors</code>” is equal “on” in the <strong>php.ini</strong> or declare “<code>ini_set('display_errors', 1)</code>” in your script.<br />\nThen, include “<code>error_reporting(E_ALL)</code>” in your code to display all types of error messages during the script execution.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is the difference between <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>GET displays the submitted data as part of the URL, during POST this information is not shown as it’s encoded in the request.</li>\n<li>GET can handle a maximum of 2048 characters, POST has no such restrictions.</li>\n<li>GET allows only ASCII data, POST has no restrictions, binary data are also allowed.</li>\n<li>Normally GET is used to retrieve data while POST to insert and update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What are Traits?</strong></h3>\n<p>Traits are a mechanism that allows you to create reusable code in languages like PHP where multiple inheritance is not supported. A Trait cannot be instantiated on its own.</p>\n<h3><strong>Can you extend a <code>Final</code> defined class?</strong></h3>\n<p>No, you cannot extend a <code>Final</code> defined class. A <code>Final</code> class or method declaration prevents child class or method overriding.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the 3 scope levels available in PHP and how would you define them?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Private</strong> – Visible only in its own class<br />\n<strong>Public</strong> – Visible to any other code accessing the class<br />\n<strong>Protected</strong> – Visible only to classes parent(s) and classes that extend the current class</p>\n<h3><strong>How does one prevent the following Warning ‘Warning: Cannot modify header information – headers already sent’ and why does it occur in the first place?</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>What are SQL Injections, how do you prevent them and what are the best practices?</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>These are a few PHP related questions for an interview.</p>\n","link":"https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/php-interview-questions-answers/","categories":[{"name":"PHP","slug":"php"}],"tags":[{"name":"beginner","slug":"beginner"},{"name":"interview","slug":"interview"},{"name":"moderate","slug":"moderate"}],"author":{"name":"admin"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"7 min read"}},"featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5857284440039643,"src":"/static/6581974289a412b0c7db3591f3bff2e9/f18b1/oia-416136_19201.jpg","srcSet":"/static/6581974289a412b0c7db3591f3bff2e9/6d0bd/oia-416136_19201.jpg 288w,\n/static/6581974289a412b0c7db3591f3bff2e9/6806c/oia-416136_19201.jpg 576w,\n/static/6581974289a412b0c7db3591f3bff2e9/f18b1/oia-416136_19201.jpg 1152w,\n/static/6581974289a412b0c7db3591f3bff2e9/a5547/oia-416136_19201.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"php-interview-questions-answers","previous":null,"next":{"id":"19621078-05f6-5cb1-9d72-18556ade85ca","slug":"differences-between-session-and-cookies-in-php","title":"Differences between Session and Cookies in PHP","status":"publish"}}}}
