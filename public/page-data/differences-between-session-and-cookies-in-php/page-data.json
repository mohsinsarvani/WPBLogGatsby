In a nutshell,</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Session</strong></td><td><strong>Cookies</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Data are stored on the server.</td><td>Cookies Data are stored on client-side or user’s browser.</td></tr><tr><td>Session data are more secured as they never travel on every HTTP request.</td><td>Cookies data are less secured as they are travel with each and every HTTP request.</td></tr><tr><td>You can store the objects in session ( Store large amount of data ).</td><td>You can store only string type of data in cookies ( Max file size is 4kb ).</td></tr><tr><td>The session cannot be used for future references.</td><td>Cookies are mostly used for future references.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A cookie (also referred to as a <strong>web cookie</strong>, <strong>tracking cookie</strong>, <strong>HTTP cookie</strong>, <strong>browser cookie</strong>) is a small piece of data stored by a user’s browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) when they visit a website. It contains information regarding browsing activity and is <strong>typically used to personalize the user’s experience or for authentication and verification purposes</strong>. <strong>Session cookies</strong> and <strong>persistent cookies</strong> are common types of cookies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Cookies?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When there&nbsp;is&nbsp;a series of continuous request and response from a same client to a server, the server cannot identify from which client it&nbsp;is&nbsp;getting requests. Because HTTP&nbsp;is&nbsp;a stateless protocol. When there&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;need&nbsp;to maintain the conversational state,&nbsp;session&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;is needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Session Cookies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Session cookies, also known as transient cookies, are temporary. They <strong>don’t have an expiration date </strong>attached and only store information about what the user does during a&nbsp;<strong>single session</strong>. A session is simply a randomly generated/unique value that is assigned when someone visits a website. Session cookies are stored temporarily in memory and are automatically removed when the browser closes or the session ends(logout).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Persistent Cookies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Persistent cookies that <strong>contain an expiration date</strong>. These last much longer and are&nbsp;<strong>stored on disk until they expire</strong>&nbsp;<strong>or are manually cleared</strong>&nbsp;by the user. These are also sometimes referred to as “tracking cookies,” as these are the types of cookies that Google Analytics, Stripe, etc. all use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cookies in WordPress Context</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordPress core</strong> uses cookies for two different purposes:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Login Cookies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Login cookies contain authentication details and are used when a user logs into the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/wordpress-admin/\">WordPress admin dashboard</a>. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Cookies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress Codex</a>, a couple of different session cookies are set:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>On login, WordPress uses the&nbsp;<code>wordpress_[hash]</code>&nbsp;cookie to store authentication details (limited to the&nbsp;<code>/wp-admin/</code>&nbsp;area).</li><li>After login, WordPress sets the&nbsp;<code>wordpress_logged_in_[hash]</code>&nbsp;cookie. This indicates when you’re logged in and who you are.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When you try to access the back-end of your WordPress site, a check is done to see if the two cookies above exist and haven’t expired. This is what allows you to magically bypass the&nbsp;<code>wp-login.php</code>&nbsp;screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wp-session-1024x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-361\" srcset=\"https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wp-session-1024x498.jpg 1024w, https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wp-session-300x146.jpg 300w, https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wp-session-768x374.jpg 768w, https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wp-session-700x341.jpg 700w, https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wp-session-822x400.jpg 822w, https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wp-session.jpg 1315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress also sets&nbsp;<code>wp-settings-{time}-[UID]</code>&nbsp;cookies. The ID being your user ID from the WordPress users database table. This stores personal dashboard and admin interface settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Comment Cookies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, there are cookies set when someone comments on a blog post (with an expiration of 347 days). This is so if they come back later they don’t have to fill out all the information all over again. The following three cookies are stored:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>comment_author_[hash]</code></li><li><code>comment_author_email_[hash]</code></li><li><code>comment_author_url_[hash]</code></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with recent privacy policy changes due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-gdpr-compliance/\">GDPR</a>, new tools have been introduced by WordPress core to make sure you let users opt-in to these cookies being set.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Third-party cookies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like WordPress uses cookies for certain functionality, third-party plugins and themes you install also set cookies. Most of them use a <strong>combination of browser cookies and database rows</strong> stored in the <code>wp_options</code> table or their own custom table. This is because WordPress is stateless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are just a couple of the many examples of what cookies are used for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you have a <strong>popup box</strong> on your WordPress site and a visitor closes it, this typically will set a cookie so that it doesn’t come back again.</li><li>Items added to a <strong>shopping cart on your ecommerce site</strong>. A cookie is stored so that the shopping cart keeps your products while you continue to browse around the site.</li><li>GeoIP features might store the IP address and latitude/longitude coordinates of the visitor browsing the site. This is typically used to show specific content to a certain region or perhaps even redirect the user to a different subsite.</li><li><strong>Tracking activity across clicks</strong> with a link shortener like the PrettyLinks plugin.</li><li>Newsletter plugin might set a cookie for users if they’ve already subscribed, this gives the ability to hide the newsletter box completely.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>WooCommerce Cookies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep track of cart data,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-cookies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce sets the following three cookies</a>&nbsp;(no personal information is stored in the cookies):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>woocommerce_cart_hash</code></li><li><code>woocommerce_items_in_cart</code></li><li><code>wp_woocommerce_session_</code></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The first two cookies contain information about the cart and simply help WooCommerce know when the cart data changes. The third cookie <code>wp_woocommerce_session_</code> contains a unique code for each customer which corresponds to an entry in the custom <code>wp_woocommerce_sessions</code> table in the database.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/woo-sessions.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-364\" srcset=\"https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/woo-sessions.jpg 860w, https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/woo-sessions-300x228.jpg 300w, https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/woo-sessions-768x583.jpg 768w, https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/woo-sessions-700x532.jpg 700w, https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/woo-sessions-527x400.jpg 527w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\" /><figcaption>WooCommerce session in separate table</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>wp_commerce_session_</code> data was previously stored in the <code>wp_options</code> table, but was moved to its own custom table in WooCommerce 2.5 when they introduced a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/new-session-handler-in-2-5/\" target=\"_blank\">new session handler</a>. This was to improve performance, scalability, and management of sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PHP Sessions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A PHP session is much like a normal session which ends when the user closes their browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see code using&nbsp;<code>session_start</code>&nbsp;on your site, this means its using PHP sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many plugin and theme developers have moved to using a combination of browser cookies and database rows (either in the&nbsp;<code>wp_options</code>&nbsp;table or their own custom table). If you need session data this is the better approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP sessions is an alternative to the standard cookie approach.&nbsp;It’s still a cookie, but it’s called&nbsp;PHPSESSID and is typically stored in the&nbsp;<code>/tmp/</code>&nbsp;directory on the web server itself. The way the server knows to associate a given session with a given request is that it’s also stored in an HTTP cookie.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>What are the difference between Session and Cookies in PHP?</p>\n","link":"https://zakirsajib.000webhostapp.com/differences-between-session-and-cookies-in-php/","categories":[{"name":"PHP","slug":"php"}],"tags":[{"name":"cookie","slug":"cookie"},{"name":"session","slug":"session"}],"author":{"name":"admin"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"5 min read"}},"featured_media":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.499531396438613,"src":"/static/fe9b2ec849f3bd63c9b00511e893012f/f18b1/photography-349870_19201.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fe9b2ec849f3bd63c9b00511e893012f/6d0bd/photography-349870_19201.jpg 288w,\n/static/fe9b2ec849f3bd63c9b00511e893012f/6806c/photography-349870_19201.jpg 576w,\n/static/fe9b2ec849f3bd63c9b00511e893012f/f18b1/photography-349870_19201.jpg 1152w,\n/static/fe9b2ec849f3bd63c9b00511e893012f/a5547/photography-349870_19201.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"differences-between-session-and-cookies-in-php","previous":{"id":"4d1c5792-11c5-567c-9ad9-367044c9623c","slug":"php-interview-questions-answers","title":"PHP interview questions and answers (beginner to moderate)","status":"publish"},"next":{"id":"5cb0fd1e-adb3-5f08-9fc2-a506f1bbf879","slug":"fix-mysql-installation-in-your-mac-osx-el-eapitan-10-11-16","title":"Fix mysql installation in your Mac OSX EL Capitan 10.11.16","status":"publish"}}}}
