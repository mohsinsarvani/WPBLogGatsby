It’s long, hot days and warm, fragrant nights make it a ripe time to recharge and re-inspire ourselves before the transformational “back to school” energy of the fall. Our reading list is a prayer for hope and a call for direct action — personal and for the world at large. It inspires you to take steps to make political interventions and personal revelations for a hopeful future — all which can happen while you’re enjoying beach vacation or getting sexy with your summer fling. We’re learning the value of micro-activisms this July and August. .</p><h4>1. <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Out-Wreckage-New-Politics-Crisis-ebook/dp/B01LX5A54F/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532637728&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=out+of+the+wreckage\"><em>Out of the Wreckage: A New Politics for an Age of Crisis</em></a> by George Monbiot</strong></h4><p>If you’re depressed by the current state of global politics and ready for a revolutionary change, George Monbiot's <em>Out Of the Wreckage</em> is a must read.

It is often lovingly and solemnly handed down from one woman to another, and until it’s been read by the recipient, the full impact of the gift can’t be understood. Este’s dense, earthy, poetic book dives so deep into the female psyche it is impossible not to come out the other side completely transformed. With poetic prose and fiery passion, Estes uses myths, fairy tales, and stories to help women reconnect with their “natural wild self” and reconstruct what is broken. If someone hasn’t yet handed a copy to you, it will be the best gift you give yourself. Just be sure to then pass it on.</p></div></div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\t</section>\n\t\n\t\t<section class=\"fw-main-row \" style=\"padding:3rem 0;\">\n\t\t<div class=\"fw-container\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"fw-row\">\n\t\n\n<div class=\"fw-col-xs-12 fw-col-sm-6 \" >\n\t<div data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-once=\"false\" data-aos-easing=\"ease-in-out\" class=\"fw-image-hover no\"  ><img src=\"https://www.thefrontlash.com/wp-content/themes/frontlash/static/dist/img/loader.svg\" data-srcset=\"//www.thefrontlash.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/51gZKmR5yGL.jpg\" alt=\"//www.thefrontlash.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/51gZKmR5yGL.jpg\" class=\" aligncenter lazyload\" /></div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"fw-col-xs-12 fw-col-sm-6 \" >\n\t<div id=\"text-block-315006d5cff2a13688fb6672d462b279\" class=\"text-block col-lg-12\">\n<h4></h4><h4></h4><h4>6. <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Badass-Doubting-Greatness-ebook/dp/B00B3M3VWS\">You Are A Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life</a> </em>by Jen Sincero</h4><p>Hate self-help books?

Merely four-letters it encompasses so many things in our world from Soylent (“the universe's easiest nutritious food”) to iceberg lettuce. Kristin Lawless’s book <em>Formerly Known As Food</em> is an illuminating and engrossing read that is expansive in its scope yet pointed in its message: the creepy reach of corporate interests has pervasively changed how we eat and effectively altered our genetic makeup, what we think is “healthy” (i.e. non-fat milk), and what we define as food in ways that are irreversible and damaging. Her research spooks you like a sci-fi thriller, but also has the luscious energy of a 1970s feminist manifesto that will galvanize you to “act as if our lives depend on it.”</p></div></div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\t</section>\n\t\n\t\t<section class=\"fw-main-row \" style=\"padding:3rem 0;\">\n\t\t<div class=\"fw-container\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"fw-row\">\n\t\n\n<div class=\"fw-col-xs-12 fw-col-sm-6 \" >\n\t<div data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-once=\"false\" data-aos-easing=\"ease-in-out\" class=\"fw-image-hover no\"  ><img src=\"https://www.thefrontlash.com/wp-content/themes/frontlash/static/dist/img/loader.svg\" data-srcset=\"//www.thefrontlash.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/we_are_the_ones_we_are_waiting_for_pb.jpg\" alt=\"//www.thefrontlash.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/we_are_the_ones_we_are_waiting_for_pb.jpg\" class=\" aligncenter lazyload\" /></div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"fw-col-xs-12 fw-col-sm-6 \" >\n\t<div id=\"text-block-9d2b0313787d76094129506f5e69fcd7\" class=\"text-block col-lg-12\">\n<h4>9. <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Are-Ones-Have-Been-Waiting-ebook/dp/B003XU7IEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532653745&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=we+are+the+ones+we+have+been+waiting+for\">We are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For: Inner Light in a Time of Darkness</a> </em>by Alice Walker</h4><p>Reading poet, and novelist, Alice Walker, is like a long, warm embrace from someone you love after a time of turmoil. Her gentle wisdom exudes compassion and acts as a soothing balm against the aggression in the world. Walker reminds us how to connect with nature and each other, in the graceful way only she can: “Sit on the Earth, our Mother, and thank Her for her loyalty and devotion to you, whatever your condition of your people has been. Tell Her that where ever you go, you will never desert her. That you will do everything in your power to return Her the care she has extended to you and yours. That you understand she is your true country and your eternal home. Kiss her pinecones, caress her turtle shells, admire the variety of her clouds, trees, oceans, beans. Remember, She is alive and wanting and needing affection just as you do. You will be with Her always though countries and governments crumble into Her dust.” This is a book to revisit every summer.</p></div></div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\t</section>\n\t</p>\n","date":"July 27, 2018","categories":[{"name":"Progress","slug":"progress-a-new-way"}],"tags":[{"name":"Reading","slug":"reading"}],"author":{"name":"Zakir Sajib","slug":"zakiruk"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c9b906cd-11fa-5afa-8f69-2fc910406ef3"}}}
